ALGORITHM (For Transmitting Single character)
1. Start
2. Initialize serial communication in mode 1 or mode 3 operation (SCON =50H
or 0D8H)
3. Initialize timer 1 in auto reload mode (mode 2 ) to generate baud rate (TMOD
=20H)
4. Initialize TH1 register for different baud rate For example: For 9600 baud
rate load -3 or 0fdh in th1
For 4800 baud rate load -6 or 0fAh in th1
For 2400 baud rate load -12 or 0f4h in th1
5. Start timer 1
6. Take the character in Accumulator for sending it serially
7. Call transmit subroutine
8. Repeat the procedure for sending different character from step 6 and 7 .
9. Repeat it for continuous operation from step 6
10. Stop
Algorithm (Subroutine for Transmit):
11. Take the character from Accumulator to SBUF register for transmitting seri-
ally
12. Monitor TI flag, that all the bits are transfer or not
13. Flash the LEDâ€™s for every one second continuously
14. If transfer TI bit becomes set, to transfer another byte clear TI bit
15. Return to main program

Algorithmor (Transmitting and receiving):

1. Start
2. Initialize Serial Communication
Set up UART in Mode 1 or Mode 3 (SCON = 50H or 0D8H).
Configure Timer 1 in Auto-Reload Mode (TMOD = 20H) for baud rate generation.
Load the TH1 register with appropriate values for different baud rates:
For 9600 baud rate: TH1 = 0FDH (-3)
For 4800 baud rate: TH1 = 0FAH (-6)
For 2400 baud rate: TH1 = 0F4H (-12)
3. Start Timer 1
Set TR1 bit to start timer (SETB TR1).
4. Full-Duplex Communication Process
Step 1: Wait for Incoming Data from PC
Monitor the Receive Interrupt Flag (RI).
If RI is set, move the received data from SBUF to the accumulator (A).
Clear RI flag (CLR RI) for the next reception.
Store the received character in memory or process it.
Step 2: Transmit the Received Data Back to PC
Move the received data from the accumulator to SBUF.
Wait for the Transmit Interrupt Flag (TI) to be set.
Clear TI flag (CLR TI) after successful transmission.
Step 3: Repeat the Process for Continuous Communication
Jump back to Step 1 for continuous data transfer.
